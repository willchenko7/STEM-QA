"A 10 kg weight is hanging from a ceiling by a rope. What is the tension in the rope assuming the system is in equilibrium?"
"A signboard is supported by two wires, one making a 30-degree angle to the left and the other a 45-degree angle to the right, both with the horizontal. If the signboard weighs 200 N, what is the tension in the left wire?"
"A small object is suspended by three cables in 3D space. Cable A applies a force of 50 N along the positive x-axis, Cable B applies a force of 60 N along the negative y-axis. If the object is in equilibrium, what is the force applied by Cable C along the positive z-axis?"
"A flagpole is being pulled by two ropes. One rope applies a force of 100 N at a 30-degree angle upwards from the horizontal, and another applies a force of 120 N horizontally. What is the vertical force needed at the base of the flagpole to maintain equilibrium?"
"In a room, a small light fixture is held in place by three wires. The first wire exerts a force of 20 N along a vector angled 30 degrees from the x-axis and 45 degrees from the y-axis. The second wire exerts a force of 25 N along a vector angled 60 degrees from the x-axis and 30 degrees from the z-axis. If the system is in equilibrium, what is the force exerted by the third wire?"
"A 15 kg object is placed on a frictionless horizontal surface. If a horizontal force of 60 N is applied to the right, what is the force required to the left to maintain equilibrium?"
"A small statue is held in place by two cables. One is angled 20 degrees above the horizontal and has a tension of 45 N. The other is angled 15 degrees below the horizontal. What is the tension in the second cable for equilibrium?"
"A drone is stabilized in the air by three thrusters. Thruster A exerts a force of 30 N in the positive x-direction, and Thruster B exerts 40 N in the negative y-direction. What is the force exerted by Thruster C in the positive z-direction for the drone to remain in static equilibrium?"
